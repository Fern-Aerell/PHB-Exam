## About the Project

The PHB (Penilaian Harian Bulanan) exam is held every month at my school, SMK PGRI. Since the exam is still conducted using Google Forms, I took the initiative to create a web version during my internship at Garuda Cyber Institute. I'm not sure if other schools use a similar system, but this website was designed and developed to be usable by any school.
